# Scripts i wrote poorly that i called them noob

## lazy_nmap.sh
### Doing nmap scan the way i wanted!

**Note!!!**
- If you have nmap installed, you good.
- Only take 1 IP address/domain as the input. I might rewrite to accept multiple IPs/domains later in the future (we'll see).

Usage:
```bash
$ ./lazy_nmap.sh [IP_ADDRESS/Domain]
```
